# Product Inventory Application using .NET Core 6 and React JS with CRUD Operations Full Stack Developer .Net Core

Introduction
In this article, we will create a product management web API with CRUD operations using .NET Core 6 and different forms with the help of React JS.

Prerequisites
Visual Studio 2022
VS Code
SQL Server
.NET Core SDK
Node JS

Execute the following entity framework database migration command to create a database and tables.
add-migration “v1”
update-database

To run an existing React application, follow these steps:

1. Install Node.js and npm:
Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine. You can check if it's installed by running:

bash
Copy code
node -v
npm (Node Package Manager) comes with Node.js, so it should be installed as well. You can check by running:

bash
Copy code
npm -v
If Node.js and npm are not installed, download and install them from the official Node.js website.

2. Clone or download the React application:
If the React project is in a version control system like Git, clone the repository to your local machine:
bash
Copy code
git clone <repository-url>
If you have a zipped file, extract it to a directory on your machine.
3. Navigate to the project directory:
Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the root directory of the React application:
bash
Copy code
cd path/to/your/react-app
4. Install dependencies:
Run the following command to install all the necessary dependencies defined in the package.json file:
bash
Copy code
npm install
This command will create a node_modules directory in your project with all the packages your application needs.
5. Run the development server:
After the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server by running:
bash
Copy code
npm start
This command will start the development server, and you should see output similar to:
bash
Copy code
Compiled successfully!

You can now view your React application in the browser.

Local:            http://localhost:3000
On Your Network:  http://<your-ip>:3000
Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to view the running React application.
6. Build for production (optional):
If you want to build the application for production, run:
bash
Copy code
npm run build
This will create a build directory with optimized production-ready files that you can deploy to a web server.
7. Troubleshooting:
If you encounter issues, check for errors in the terminal. Common problems include missing dependencies or version conflicts.
You may also want to check the project’s documentation or README.md file for any specific setup instructions.
This should help you successfully run the existing React application on your machine.
